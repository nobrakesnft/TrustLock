        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: January 31, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By using DealPact ("the Service"), including our Telegram bot and associated website, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2>2. What DealPact Is</h2>
        <p>DealPact is a peer-to-peer escrow service that uses smart contracts on the Base blockchain to hold USDC funds during transactions between buyers and sellers. DealPact acts as a neutral intermediary — we do not buy, sell, or trade any goods or services ourselves.</p>

        <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old and legally able to enter into agreements in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring your use of DealPact complies with local laws.</p>

        <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your wallet address. Funds sent to a wrong address cannot be recovered.</li>
            <li>You must not use DealPact for illegal transactions, money laundering, fraud, or any prohibited activity.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for securing your Telegram account and crypto wallet. DealPact is not liable for unauthorized access to your accounts.</li>
            <li>You must not register a wallet address that belongs to another person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Escrow Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sellers create deals specifying a buyer, amount, and description.</li>
            <li>Buyers deposit USDC into the smart contract.</li>
            <li>After the seller delivers, the buyer releases funds.</li>
            <li>If there is a disagreement, either party may open a dispute.</li>
            <li>DealPact administrators will review disputes and may release funds to the seller or refund the buyer based on available evidence.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Fees</h2>
        <p>DealPact charges a 1.5% escrow fee on completed transactions. This fee is deducted from the funds at the time of release. Fee rates may change with notice.</p>

        <h2>7. Disputes and Resolution</h2>
        <p>DealPact provides dispute resolution as a convenience. Administrators review evidence submitted by both parties and make a decision in good faith. Dispute resolution decisions are final within the platform. DealPact does not guarantee outcomes and is not a legal arbitration service.</p>

        <h2>8. Smart Contract Risks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>DealPact relies on smart contracts deployed on the Base blockchain. While we take precautions, smart contracts may contain bugs or vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Blockchain transactions are irreversible. Once funds are released on-chain, they cannot be reversed by DealPact.</li>
            <li>Network congestion, gas fees, and blockchain outages are beyond our control.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Cryptocurrency Disclaimer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>DealPact is not a financial service, exchange, or investment platform.</li>
            <li>Cryptocurrency values can fluctuate. DealPact is not responsible for changes in token value during the escrow period.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for understanding the risks of using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.</li>
            <li>DealPact does not provide financial, legal, or tax advice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>DealPact is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DealPact is not liable for any loss of funds due to smart contract bugs, blockchain issues, user error, or third-party actions.</li>
            <li>DealPact is not liable for the quality, legality, or delivery of goods or services exchanged between users.</li>
            <li>Our total liability shall not exceed the fees paid by you in the 12 months preceding the claim.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>You may not use DealPact to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Facilitate illegal transactions or money laundering</li>
            <li>Buy or sell prohibited items (drugs, weapons, stolen goods, etc.)</li>
            <li>Defraud other users</li>
            <li>Manipulate or exploit the smart contract or bot</li>
            <li>Create multiple accounts to circumvent restrictions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Account Termination</h2>
        <p>DealPact reserves the right to restrict or terminate access to any user who violates these terms, engages in fraudulent activity, or abuses the platform. Active deals will be resolved before termination where possible.</p>

        <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms at any time. Continued use of DealPact after changes constitutes acceptance. Major changes will be announced through the bot.</p>

        <h2>14. Contact</h2>
